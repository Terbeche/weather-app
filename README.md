## Features

### Main Page

- **Weather Table:** Displays weather information for each chosen location, including:
  - An icon representing the weather condition (based on the WMO code).
  - The location's name.
  - The current temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - The current rainfall in millimeters.
  - A "Remove" button for each location. Clicking this button triggers a confirmation popup before the location is deleted from the table.

### Detailed Forecast

- **Forecast Sidebar:** Clicking on a row within the table opens a sidebar. This sidebar provides a detailed temperature and rainfall forecast for the next 7 days for the selected location.

### Location Management

- **Add Location:** A button above the table allows users to add new locations. This opens a popup where users can search for and select a location to add to the table. The form cannot be submitted if no location is selected.
